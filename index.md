# Pickle & Structured Exceptions

## Introduction

In this assignment I searched the web to learn about pickling data and storing it in a dat file and learned how to use structured exceptions so I may make my own user-friendly errors for the end user.  I made a simple program that takes in sensitive data from the user and stores the data in binary and gives friendly errors when data is entered incorrectly.

## Pickling 

In this assignment I first start by importing the pickle module. I asked the user multiple sensitive question once I asked the use multiple  question I captured the data using a variable. I open a new file and use the ‘wb’ for writing in binary. Once I open the file in ‘wb’ mode I use the pickle function ‘dump’ to populate the dat file with the information I would like. The data I choose to populate is the same data I accepted from the user. See figure 1 for the functions I call to open and write to the file in binary.
